        <p>Indonesia primarily follows Islam, but in Bali the majority of Balinese people believe in a form Hinduism called Agama Hindu Dharma (not to be confused with the Indian Hindu religion). However, Balinese Hindu and Indian Hindu do have some similarities such as they do believe in karma and reincarnation. Although, there is no caste system with untouchables or child marriages, if any they are rare. Muslims in Indonesia generally are not as strict as some countries. There is no segregation between women and men and the usual mandatory head covering (hijab) is not enforced, but it is very common, polygamy is rare. The Hindus worship many Gods and Demons, which is an aspect of Buddhism. Buddhism is practiced in Bali but it's not as common. The trinity of Brahma, Shiva and Vishmu are the most important ones. Ancestral Gods correlate to the island; they represent elements such as, earth, mountains, water and fire. Rice, fertility, and technology also have their own God. Balinese people express their religion in ceremonies and rituals at home and in temples. Bali is known for their abundant number of island temples. When entering a temple women and men wear sarongs wrapped around the waist with their shoulders, chest and knees covered. Women, though can not enter a temple when on her period and cannot pray when on her period, pregnant and women who recently gave birth can not either. They are considered unclean at those times. Be sure to visit some temples and be on the lookout for flower offerings as they are very common in everyday life, since everyone is always celebrating life, death or even a wedding.</p>

        <p>Balinese is mainly spoken in Bali and in northern Nusa Penida, western Lombok and eastern Java, but most native to the island also know Indonesian. Balinese is a Malaya-Polynesian language. The alphabet is descended from the Brahmi script of ancient India using mostly from the Pallava and Old Kawi scripts. The earliest known inscriptions are written on palm leaves called lontar dating back from the 11th century AD. The Balinese alphabet based on Sanskrit is not commonly known to all Balinese. The Balinese printed material in the Latin alphabet is limited in existence, but is used instead. Both are used in religious works, but the Latin alphabet is more used in school books and stories as it is taught in primary school.</p>

        <p>Nyepi is a part of the Balinese New Year in March. It is a purification festival that cleanses the evil spirits out of the island. The night before is celebrated with festivals, dance and music. The Ngrupuk parade featured part of the night where huge depictions of demons are brought around followed by scary noises and laughter. Although, during the Nyepi, people stay home and some Balinese fast and donâ€™t speak. Since the whole island is silent, the evil spirits believed that the Balinese has left the island and so they will leave the island as well. This event not only cleanses the spirits, but it also is a break from all the pollution of normal day activities. Its rest of nature as well.</p>
